# Third-Party Marketplace Extensions

The extension marketplace allows users to publish extensions they create themselves, or install extensions produced by other members of the community. Extensions are community-written Python modules. Extensions are not installed automatically, except for a few Saleae created extensions. Before installing an extension, please keep in mind:

* Non-Saleae extensions were created and published by Saleae Logic 2 users.
* Saleae cannot endorse their contents.
* All extensions are open source and can viewed by clicking the “Repository” Link in the extension details.
* Please treat extensions the same way you would other programs downloaded from the internet. 

If you have any problems with an extension, please be sure to create an issue on the extension’s GitHub repository. If you suspect an extension does not comply with the [Saleae Marketplace Partner Agreement](https://downloads.saleae.com/Saleae+Marketplace+Partner+Agreement.pdf), please contact Saleae support.
