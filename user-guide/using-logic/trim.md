# Trimming Your Data

Your data can be cropped or trimmed as needed. This can be useful if only a portion of the data capture is needed. You can trim you capture by clicking the Options button on the bottom-right, and selecting _Trim Data_. You can trim by using a timing marker pair or by specifying a specific time range.
