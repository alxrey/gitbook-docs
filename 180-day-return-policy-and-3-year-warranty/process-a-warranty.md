## Process a Warranty - Troubleshooting Steps

{% hint style="info" %}
If you believe your Logic hardware is broken, please completely perform the troubleshooting steps below and take note of the results so we can verify the source of the problem.
{% endhint %}

**1. Test with the Latest Beta Software. Download link is below.**

* If you are running the standalone version of the Saleae software, you will need to manually install the drivers. Driver install instructions are below.

{% page-ref page="../logic-software/driver-install.md" %}



**2. Remove any USB hubs, laptop docking stations, and extension cables.** 

* Also, remove all other USB devices from your PC. Then, test the device directly on the PC, and on all other USB ports. Logic Pro 8 and Pro 16 require USB 3.0 ports.



**3. Test Logic on a second PC.**

* If the second PC also fails to connect, then it is likely a hardware issue. If so, stop here and submit a [Warranty Request](https://saleae-support.typeform.com/to/E8UPB7). Otherwise, if it fails on one PC and works on another PC, then it is likely a PC issue. In this case, continue with the steps below.



**4. Test with another USB cable**

* If another USB cable works, then your original USB cable may be faulty. If so, stop here and [Contact Support](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for help. Otherwise, continue with the steps below.



**5. Test if the device's VID and PID have failed. Instructions are below.**

* If the VID and PID are incorrect, then the hardware maybe faulty. Stop here and submit a [Warranty Request](https://saleae-support.typeform.com/to/E8UPB7).

**6. If you are troubleshooting Logic Pro 8 or Pro 16, ensure the latest USB 3.0 Host Controller is installed.** 

* Update the driver, if possible, and run the tests again. The latest host controller drivers are provided in the link below.
* The windows driver update check will NOT update USB 3.0 host controller drivers. These are not included in the Windows update driver database and must be manually updated.

### PC Detection Test

If the above steps did not resolve the issue, we need to determine if the PC can detect the Logic device:

1. Before connecting Logic to the PC, ensure the Saleae Software is **not running**.
2. Connect the device to the PC using the provided USB cable.
3. Check if the operating system \(OS\) detects the device:
   * **Windows:** Open device manager. Expand the section "Universal Serial Bus Controllers" and check for "Saleae Logic X USB Logic Analyzer" where "X" is the specific product version \(4, 8, Pro 8, etc.\). If "unidentified device" appears, then the OS did not detect it properly. If "Westbridge" appears, then there is a problem with the Saleae driver. Please re-install the driver.
   * **Linux:** Run lsusb. Check for any device name containing "Saleae" or a VID of "0x21A9" or "0x0925". Ensure the VID and PID is correct.
   * **OSX:** Open "System Report" by opening the Apple menu and selecting "About this Mac," and then select "System Report...". Then select USB under Hardware and check for "Westbridge" in the treeview.
4. If the PC detects the Logic device properly, open the Saleae software. If the Saleae software reports \[Disconnected\] at the top, then the hardware is likely OK and this may be a software issue. Proceed to the troubleshooting steps below.
